# Cat Theme

A slight blog theme, inspired by [Mirror](https://github.com/LoeiFy/Mirror).

The reason I call this theme as `Cat` is hoping that it can expand to all blog engines with its flexibility.

[DEMO IS HERE](https://kilerd.github.io/Cat/)

## Motivation

As there is no theme which meet my needs, and then I create it.
