# Cat Theme

A slight blog theme, inspired by [Mirror](https://github.com/LoeiFy/Mirror).

The reason I call this theme as `Cat` is hoping that it can expand to all blog engines with its flexibility.



## Motivation

As there is no theme which meet my needs, and then I create it.



## Support

- typecho



## Usage

- download folder `/$engine/cat` to your computer (`$engine` is your blog engine)
- move  folder `cat` to the template folder of your blog.
- turn it on at your blog management dashbroad.
- set parameters



## API Refrences

- `Avatar URL`

  The URL of your avatar showing on the header of theme.

- `Analytics Code`

  Analytics Code which is showing on the footer.
